# AIOD Metadata Catalogue

Image for AI on Demand's (AIOD) metadata catalogue REST API, developed on [Github](https://github.com/aiondemand/AIOD-rest-api/).
This image also requires _at least_ a database setup to function, but for all features authentication (through keycloak) and 
search (through elastic search) also need to be configured.
Please refer to the documentation in the readme of the ["AIOD-rest-api"](https://github.com/aiondemand/AIOD-rest-api) repository.
